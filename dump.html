{"error":false,"data:{"clipboard":"Just set the

android:scrollbars = "vertical"
properties of your TextView in your layout's xml file.

Then use:

yourTextView.setMovementMethod(new ScrollingMovementMethod())

in your code.

Bingo, it scrolls automatically without any issues.

But surely maxLines requires you to enter an arbitrary number; this isn't something that will work for every screen size and font size? I find it simpler to just wrap it with a ScrollView, meaning I don't have to add any further XML attributes or code (like setting the movement method). – Christopher Orr Dec 19 '10 at 22:57

@Christopher, ScrollView requires 'android:layout_height' too. – Regex Rookie Mar 4 '11 at 16:39

@Regex: Well yes. Either you let the ScrollView take up as much space as it needs (e.g. via the android:fillViewport attribute), or you set the specific size you want. Using maxLines should not be used to set sizes of UI elements, so that is no solution. – Christopher Orr Mar 5 '11 at 12:18

Hello. For me this is not a solution (as I thought it is). I have to create all the layout programatically here and when using just a TextView with ScrollMovementMethod(), it scrolls like a 3 px/scroll and very jerky. This TextView is in LineraLayout which is within a ScrollView. When I try to surround thhis TextView with another ScrollView - how can I set the height for it??? Remember - I'm not using any XML here...and ScrollView does not have a .setHeight() method. Any suggestion? – shadyyx May 14 '11 at 15:24

Stumbled upon this by chance: I might be waking up a zombie here. But to answer this question you can either:
1. Surround the TextView by a ScrollView OR
2. set the Movement method to ScrollingMovementMethod.getInstance();

All that is really necessary is the setMovementMethod(). Heres an exmple using a LinearLayout.

main.xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:orientation="vertical"
    android:layout_width="fill_parent"
    android:layout_height="fill_parent"
    >
<TextView  
    android:id="@+id/tv1"
    android:layout_width="fill_parent" 
    android:layout_height="fill_parent" 
    android:text="@string/hello"
    />
</LinearLayout>
WordExtractTest.java
public class WordExtractTest extends Activity {

    TextView tv1;

    /** Called when the activity is first created. */
    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.main);

        tv1 = (TextView)findViewById(R.id.tv1);

        loadDoc();
    }

    private void loadDoc(){

        String s = "";

        for(int x=0;x<=100;x++){
            s += "Line: "+String.valueOf(x)+"\n";
        }

        tv1.setMovementMethod(new ScrollingMovementMethod());

        tv1.setText(s);

    }
}

no scroll bars, and scrolling is clunky compared to the ScrollView method. – Jeffrey Blattman Sep 14 '12 at 21:59

I didn't find TextView scrolling to support the 'fling' gesture, where it continues scrolling after a flick up or down. I ended up implementing that myself because I didn't want to use a ScrollView for various reasons, and there didn't seem to be a MovementMethod that both allowed me to select text and click on links.

This is how I did it purely in XML:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:orientation="vertical"
    android:layout_width="fill_parent"
    android:layout_height="fill_parent">

    <ScrollView
    android:id="@+id/SCROLLER_ID"
    android:layout_width="fill_parent"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:scrollbars="vertical"
    android:fillViewport="true">

        <TextView
        android:id="@+id/TEXT_STATUS_ID"
        android:layout_width="fill_parent"
        android:layout_height="fill_parent"
        android:layout_weight="1.0"/>

    </ScrollView>

</LinearLayout>
NOTES:

1) android:fillViewport="true" combined with android:layout_weight="1.0" will make the textview take up all available space.

2) When defining the Scrollview, DO NOT specify android:layout_height="fill_parent" otherwise the scrollview doesn't work ! (This has caused me to waste an hour just now! FFS)

PRO TIP:

to programmatically scroll to the bottom after appending text, use this:

mTextStatus = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.TEXT_STATUS_ID);
mScrollView = (ScrollView) findViewById(R.id.SCROLLER_ID);

private void scrollToBottom()
{
    mScrollView.post(new Runnable()
    { 
        public void run()
        { 
            mScrollView.smoothScrollTo(0, mTextStatus.getBottom());
        } 
    });
}

There's no need to use mTextView.getBottom(), just use the method mScrollView.fullScroll(View.FOCUS_DOWN) as it is a part of the ScrollView API. See here and here for more info. – Chuong Sep 11 at 19:59

Best way I found:

Replace the TextView with an EditText with these extra attributes:

android:background="@null"
android:editable="false"
android:cursorVisible="false"
No need for wrapping in ScrollView.

Easily the best and most appropriate answer, especially considering that EditText is a TextView subclass and the question is how to make the textview scrollable, not how to work around the problem. Would vote up twice if I could :) – Justin Buser Jul 8 '12 at 15:38

@JustinBuser Couldn't disagree more. :) It's purely serendipitous that this works, and there's no guarantee it will in future versions of Android. If you want scrolling, use the scrolling tools that Android provides. ScrollView is the correct way to go. – Madbreaks Oct 24 '12 at 0:53
 	
 	
@Madbreaks There is nothing "serendipitous" about it, EditText IS a TextView with a few added methods and overrides that is specifically tailored to accommodate varying length text. In particular EditText overrides the return value for the TextView getDefaultMovementMethod function. The default implementation returns NULL, EditText basically does the same thing all these other answers are suggesting. As far as using the tools that Android provides is concerned, the EditText class is far less likely to become deprecated than any of the other methods found in these answers. – Justin Buser Oct 27 '12 at 14:32

@JustinBuser My problem with that though is you're depending on the default behavior of EditText, that is what I meant may very well change down the road (not at all that EditText would be deprecated). You can argue that, but again, the idea is to use components and features that are appropriate for the task at hand. ScrollView was explicitly designed to encompass scrolling. I always try to, and always suggest others use the right tool for the job. There are almost always multiple approaches to any given programming problem. Anyway, thanks for the thoughtful response. – Madbreaks Oct 29 '12 at 17:57

This is "How to apply ScrollBar to your TextView", using only XML?

First, you need to take Textview control in main.xml file and write some text into it ... like this:

<TextView 
    android:id="@+id/TEXT" 
    android:layout_height="wrap_content" 
    android:layout_width="wrap_content" 
    android:text="@string/long_text"/>
Next,place the text view control in between the scrollview to display the scroll bar for this text:

<RelativeLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android" 
    android:orientation="vertical" 
    android:layout_height="wrap_content" 
    android:layout_width="fill_parent"> 

    <ScrollView 
        android:id="@+id/ScrollView01" 
        android:layout_height="150px" 
        android:layout_width="fill_parent"> 

        <TextView 
            android:id="@+id/TEXT" 
            android:layout_height="wrap_content" 
            android:layout_width="wrap_content" 
            android:text="@string/long_text"/> 

    </ScrollView>
</RelativeLayout>
That's it...

when you done with scrollable add this line to view last line when you enter anything in view

((ScrollView) findViewById(R.id.TableScroller)).fullScroll(View.FOCUS_DOWN);

If you don't want to use the EditText solution then you might have better luck with:

@Override
public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.yourLayout);
    (TextView)findViewById(R.id.yourTextViewId).setMovementMethod(ArrowKeyMovementMethod.getInstance());
}

This will provide smooth scrolling text with a scroll bar.

ScrollView scroller = new ScrollView(this);
TextView tv = new TextView(this);
tv.setText(R.string.my_text);
scroller.addView(tv);

If you want text to be scrolled within the textview, then you can follow the following:

First you should have to subclass textview.

and then use that .

Following is an example of subclassed textview.

public class AutoScrollableTextView extends TextView {


    public AutoScrollableTextView(Context context, AttributeSet attrs, int defStyle) {
        super(context, attrs, defStyle);
    setEllipsize(TruncateAt.MARQUEE);
    setMarqueeRepeatLimit(-1);
    setSingleLine();
    setHorizontallyScrolling(true);
    }

    public AutoScrollableTextView(Context context, AttributeSet attrs) {
        super(context, attrs);
    setEllipsize(TruncateAt.MARQUEE);
    setMarqueeRepeatLimit(-1);
    setSingleLine();
    setHorizontallyScrolling(true);
    }

    public AutoScrollableTextView(Context context) {
        super(context);   
    setEllipsize(TruncateAt.MARQUEE);
    setMarqueeRepeatLimit(-1);
    setSingleLine();
    setHorizontallyScrolling(true);

    }
    @Override
    protected void onFocusChanged(boolean focused, int direction, Rect previouslyFocusedRect) {
        if(focused)
            super.onFocusChanged(focused, direction, previouslyFocusedRect);
    }

    @Override
    public void onWindowFocusChanged(boolean focused) {
        if(focused)
            super.onWindowFocusChanged(focused);
    }


    @Override
    public boolean isFocused() {
        return true;
    }
}
Now, you have to use that in the xml in this way,

 <com.yourpackagename.AutoScrollableTextView
                android:layout_width="fill_parent"
                android:layout_height="wrap_content"                    
                android:text="This is very very long text to be scrolled"
                />
Thats it.

This is my very first code contribution to Stack Overflow, and only my 2nd answer, but this took me a long time to figure out, so I'm thinking that it might be helpful to someone else, although it does seem obvious now. The "pro tip" above from Someone Somewhere (Making TextView Scrollable in Android) works great, however, what if you're dynamically adding text to the ScrollView and would like to automatically scroll to the bottom after an append only when the user is at the bottom of the ScrollView? (Perhaps because if the user has scrolled up to read something you don't want to automatically reset to the bottom during an append, which would be annoying.)

Anyway, here it is:

if ((mTextStatus.getMeasuredHeight() - mScrollView.getScrollY()) <=
        (mScrollView.getHeight() + mTextStatus.getLineHeight())) {
    scrollToBottom();
}
The mTextStatus.getLineHeight() will make it so that you don't scrollToBottom() if the user is within one line from the end of the ScrollView. I hope this helps!

Make your textview just adding this

TextView textview= (TextView) findViewById(R.id.your_textview_id);
textview.setMovementMethod(new ScrollingMovementMethod());
